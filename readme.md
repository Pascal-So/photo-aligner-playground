# Photo Aligner

extracting stabilized image regions from handheld image sequences. dirty hack all around. consider this more of a playground repo that I can use as a base when quickly trying something.

```bash
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

python align.py input-path output-path
```
